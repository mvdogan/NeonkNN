# NeonkNN

Use `./kNNskl.py` to run scikit-learn kNN

kNN.py is still undergoing work. Will complete if necessary (i.e. based on performance of kNNskl.py)

##### To do:
  * Loop through files in folder - how many training images and which validation images?
  * Add header to output
  * Add validation image name to first column of output file - maybe
  * Integrate processImage
